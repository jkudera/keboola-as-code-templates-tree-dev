The process is simple. We will guide you through it, and, when needed, ask you to provide your credentials and authorize the source and destination components.

The flow, in a nutshell:

- First, the HubSpot source component will collect data from your HubSpot account (companies, deals, activities, etc.). 

- Then we will put your data into the requested shape, and you will select a destination component that will load the results either into a Snowflake database or into a Google BigQuery dataset.

- Finally, you will schedule and run the entire flow (i.e., the sequence of all the prepared, above mentioned steps, in the correct order). The source component, all data manipulations, and the Snowflake or Google BigQuery destination components, will be processed.

- At this point, your data will be prepared to be loaded into SpotApps as a reporting source. Once you are in SpotApps, enter the credentials of the database where you store your newly created data, and you can start using your reporting right away.
